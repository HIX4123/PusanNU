Why Tuple Is Faster Than List In Python ?

In python we have two types of objects. 1. Mutable, 2. Immutable. In python lists **comes under mutable objects and **tuples comes under immutable objects.

    Tuples are stored in a single block of memory. Tuples are immutable so, It doesn't require extra space to store new objects.
    Lists are allocated in two blocks: the fixed one with all the Python object information and a variable sized block for the data.
    It is the reason creating a tuple is faster than List.
    It also explains the slight difference in indexing speed is faster than lists, because in tuples for indexing it follows fewer pointers.

Advantages using tuples:¢Ò

    Tuples is that they use less memory where lists use more memory
    We can use tuples in a dictionary as a key but it's not possible with lists
    We can access element with an index in both tuples and lists

Disadvantages of tuples¢Ò

    We cannot add an element to tuple but we can add element to list.
    We can't sort a tuple but in a list we can sort by calling "list.sort()" method.
    We can't remove an element in tuple but in list we can remove element
    We can't replace an element in tuple but you can in a list
