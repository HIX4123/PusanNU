International military forces
on Wednesday stepped
up attacks on government
  troops in Misurata, 131 miles 
  east 
of 
    Tripoli. 
The airstrikes seemed to bring a 
temporary respite from the 
fighting that had raged 
for six days between forces 
loyal to Moammar Gaddafi 
and rebels, 
as government tanks retreated 
from the city center.
